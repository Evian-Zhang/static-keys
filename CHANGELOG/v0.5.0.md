# static-keys v0.5.0

Add `loongarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` target.

For x86-64 and x86 target, use strictly 5-byte JMP when generating initial static branches.

For Linux target, use copy-then-remap to modify instructions. This may be slower than the previous `mprotect`-based way, but is more general for those targets with W^X on. Moreover, this is beneficial to the future multi-threaded version.

Add additional cache clear mechanism. This is done by platform-specific instructions in [Evian-Zhang/clear-cache](https://github.com/Evian-Zhang/clear-cache).
