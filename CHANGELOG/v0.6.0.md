# static-keys v0.6.0

The `GenericStaticKey::enable` and `GenericStaticKey::disable` now accept shared reference of `self` instead of `&mut self`, and `define_static_key_false!` and `define_static_key_true!` now produce a immutable static variable. The static key has been changed to interior mutable in order to meet the Rust 2024 edition's requirement, which does not allow mutable static.

Remove feature declaration of `asm_const` since it has been stabilized in Rust 1.82.0.
